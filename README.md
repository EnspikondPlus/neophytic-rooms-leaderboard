## Rooms Green Agent

The Rooms agent orchestrates a game where a purple agent must exit from a system of rooms by moving, inspecting, getting and using keys, and transitioning between two phases of actions.

A room system (game) can be configured by providing an encoding and some hyperparameters for environment conditions.

**Scoring**

Agents are evaluated on total reward (less negative the better), total steps used (lower the better), and successful exiting of the room systems.

**Requirements for Participant Agents**

Your A2A agents must respond to natural language requests and must respond with the appropriate JSON schema outlined in the green agent's prompting.
